#  Crypto Portfolio Tracker

A full-stack web application that allows users to manage, monitor, and track their cryptocurrency investments in real-time. The application provides secure login functionality, live market price updates, and a clean, interactive dashboard for portfolio management.
This project was built during my internship to demonstrate full-stack development skills, integration of real-time APIs, and the ability to design scalable systems from scratch.

Overview
Cryptocurrency investors often need a centralized, live, and user-friendly tool to manage their holdings. This tracker allows users to:
- Add various crypto assets to their personal portfolio
- Monitor the real-time value of those assets
- Calculate total portfolio value based on market fluctuations
- View intuitive and responsive dashboards
-

Getting Started
Backend Setup
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/crypto-portfolio-tracker.git
    cd crypto_portfolio_tracker
    ```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
    ```

3. Install Python dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the Flask server:
    ```bash
    python run.py
    ```

Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the frontend server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

What I Learned
- Full-stack development using Flask and React
- API integration with real-time data
- Token-based authentication and session security
- Building scalable, modular web architectures
- Handling asynchronous data and frontend-backend sync
- Debugging complex data flows and managing component state

Challenges Faced
| Challenge                             | Solution                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Real-time API rate limits            | Added retry logic and basic caching to reduce external API dependency    |
| User session and authentication      | Implemented secure JWT token system for authentication                   |
| Data sync between frontend/backend   | Used consistent REST schema and Axios with error handling                |
| Portfolio state updates              | Optimized React component updates with `useEffect()` and state hooks     |

Future Enhancements
- Wallet address auto-sync (via blockchain APIs)
- Charting portfolio trends using Chart.js or Recharts
- Push notifications for price alerts
- Enhanced admin dashboard
- Deployment via Docker or cloud hosting (e.g., Vercel/Render)
